AppName: Proportional gain design using a phase margin
Author: John Anthony Rossiter, University of Sheffield

Creation Date: 2023

Matlab version used: 2023a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates how to perform a simple gain feedback design using Bode diagrams and a phase margin criteria. The app inlcudes a number of pre-coded examples and allows the user to investigate both how to meet the PM requirement, and the impact of this on closed-loop behaviour. The manual and app also give guidance on a mechanistic design to achieve a specified phase margin. The app also allows the user to investigage he impact of a small system delay on margins and behaviour.
