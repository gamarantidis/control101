Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates core learning outcomes linked to nonlinear bahviour. First, investigate the dynamics of position control system based on a DC servo and then consilder the impact of different nonlinear components in the system such as:  measurement noise, input saturation, backlash and parameter uncertainty. Users can also change core parameters to perform compare and contrast simulations with different assumptions. The manual and app also give guidance on the underlying scenario and how to use the simulink files directly.
