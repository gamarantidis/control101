AppName: Frequency Response Time Domain Behaviour
Author: John Anthony Rossiter, University of Sheffield

Creation Date: 2023

Matlab version used: 2023a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This is a simple interface to understand the concept of frequency response in a time domain scenario.  Users can excite a variety of lienar systems with a sinuosidal input and view the system responses. The figures are presented in such a way that users can infer the implied gain and phase shifts of the output relative to the input. Numerical calculations are also provided. More detailed technical and analytical background is provided  in the partner livescript file frequency_response_time_behaviour_manual.mlx. This file also includes some simple MATLAB code snippets than can be used for equivalent analysis.
