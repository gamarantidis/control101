App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates how system behaviour is linked to the pole positions; for convenience step responses are used for illustration. A number of pre-coded options allow the user to explore efficently a range of models and model orders, or indeed to enter the system coefficients directly. Poles and zeros can be moved with the mouse to help users understand the impact better.
