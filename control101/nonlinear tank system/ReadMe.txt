AppName: Nonlinear tank level control
Author: John Anthony Rossiter, University of Sheffield

Creation Date: 2024

Matlab version used: 2024a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox, Simulink

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates two core learning outcomes. First, how the dynamics of tank exhibit non-linear behaviour in the open-loop; this is solely available within the livescript manual file. Secondly, it introduces feedback and a number of other external and non-linear impacts such as measurement noise, input saturation, anti-windup, disturbances and parameter uncertainty. Users can also change core parameters to perform compare and contrast simulations with different assumptions. The manual and app also give guidance on the underlying scenario and how to use the simulink files directly.
