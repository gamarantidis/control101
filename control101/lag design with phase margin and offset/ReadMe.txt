App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates how to perform a simple lag compensator feedback design using Bode diagrams with a phase margin and low frequency gain criteria. The app includes a number of pre-coded examples and allows the user to investigate both how to meet the requirements and the impact of this on closed-loop behaviour. The manual and app also give guidance on a mechanistic design to achieve the specified criteria. The low frequency gain criteria takes two alternative forms depending upon whether the system includes and integrator or not. For completeness the behaviour with the lag compensator is compared with a simple gain design, so the differences can be evaluated.
