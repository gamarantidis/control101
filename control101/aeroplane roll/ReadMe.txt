Matlab version used: 2023a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates how aeroplane closed-loop roll behaviour is linked to the design of a lead compensator.  Users can select the pole/zero ratio, geometric mean and lead compensator gain and compare and contrast the impact of changes on both closed-loop behaviour and frequency response characteristics such as phase margin and cross-over frequency. Users can also change core parameters of the simplified aeroplane roll model. The manual and app also give guidance on a mechanistic design to achieve a specified phase margin and cross over frequency.
