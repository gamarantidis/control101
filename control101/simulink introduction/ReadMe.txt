App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an introduction to the use of simulink for modelling and simulation system behaviour. 
The main resource is a virtual laboratory or Matlab app which steps users through the basic elements of a simulink model, and its simulation.
