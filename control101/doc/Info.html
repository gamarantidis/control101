    <p>
<span style="font-family:Arial">
<span style="font-size:12pt">
<h2> Introductory information </h2>
Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy and quick to use, and support student understanding and learning at an introductory level. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.
	<br>
	<br>
  The community toolbox project is led by Anthony Rossiter (University of Sheffield) with sponsorship from MathWorks and input from numerous international colleagues. If you have suggestions or possible contributions, please contact Anthony (j.a.rossiter@sheffield.ac.uk).

<p style="font-family:Arial"><span style="font-size:12pt">
  <br>
  Resources are divided into:
  <br>
  1. <strong>Virtual laboratories</strong> which have simple GUI interfaces so students can select buttons and sliders to observe the behaviour of some authentic scenarios and see how different parameter choices affect behaviour. Each virtual laboratory comprises two files which run independently: i) the mlapp file which is the laboratory itself and ii) a partner livescript file which acts like a concise manual giving context, illustrative MATLAB source code and some technical background.  Naming conventions are largely self-evident. For example, a typical naming convention for the paired app files is: mixingtank_and_behaviour.mlapp and mixingtank_and_behaviour_manual.mlx. If accessing the apps via the installed toolbox and thus installed apps toolbar, the manual (mlx file) will be opened simultaneously. This link relies on correct path selection, so users who did not install the toolbox, but rather just copied all the files, will need to ensure the relevant folder is on the path.
  
  <br>
  2. <strong>Livescript files</strong> which focus more on useful MATLAB code students can use to create their own files to support detailed analysis, evaluation and design, as required for university courses and assignments.   If accessing the livescript files via the installed toolbox, typing the file name  will open a livescript with the filename ending "_mycopy" in the current working directory, so the user can easily make and save any changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A quick list of the available resources is given below, with links to more complete summary information. For a more detailed overview and recent updates, see the website:
  <a href="website">https://controleducation.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/matlabresources/community-control-toolbox</a>
  <br><br>
	Some youtube videos <a href="videos">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs7mcKy_nInHEjth9P3m_bxd6D24IVSzz</a> give quick illustrations of the toolbox and how to use the files.
	
	<br><br>
  <span style="font-size:14pt">
    Within the MATLAB command window:   <ul><br>  <li>   <strong>doc Control101 Toolbox</strong>,    will open a separate window which provides
    softlinks/shortcuts to run to all the files.</li>
	  <li><strong>help control101 </strong> also works, if the toolbox is installed but opens in the command window so is less convenient.</li>
	  </ul>

<h2 id = getting> 1. Getting started </h2>
We assume that the user has downloaded the toolbox from the add-ons button within MATLAB. The toolbox is searched for using the tag 'Control 101' or 'Control101' under the add-ons button.
<br>
	<br>
  1. All the virtual labs will appear in the apps tab as illustrated here and are started simply by selecting the relevant icon. A copy of the livescript manual will also be opened in the present working directory. 
	
<br>

</a></figure></span>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	2. To access the livescripts, either use the soft links in this file (section 2.2) or type the name in the command window (as illustrated below); this will open the relevant .mlx file in an editor window as required. 
	<br><br>
	
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> When using the installed toolbox, MATLAB will open a copy of the livescript in the present working directory so that the user can make and save edits without changing the toolbox original.

        A simple interface to practice estimation of time constant and gain from a step response for a 1st order model. The app supports students in being able to make quick and accurate estimates of the time constant and gain and to check the accuracy of their estimates against the true answers.

        This is a simple interface to understand the modelling and behaviour of simple mass-spring-damper models, but with a mildy humourous animation to help with student engagement.
        A mass-spring-damper is a simplified model of typical suspension systems and the landing of an aircraft is a nice example of suspension in action. We want to determine whether passengers are comfortable. This app allows users to investigate the impact of different masses, dampers and springs on the landing behaviour; implicitly this is linked to a understanding of under-damped 2nd order responses.
