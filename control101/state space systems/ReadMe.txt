AppName: State space systems for a first course in control

Author: John Anthony Rossiter, University of Sheffield

Creation Date: 2023

Matlab version used: 2024a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox, Simulink

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides livescript files which contain some explanation of core theory of state space systems
alongside the relevant MATLAB code to perform computations and illustrate and test understanding. Users can change the examples within the code to generate personalised solutions. The intention is to run through the skills and concepts needed for a basic introduction to state space systems up to an including introductory state feedback design and observer design. The sensible ordering to use the files is available in the general help resources of the toolbox.
